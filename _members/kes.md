description: "Hey everyone! My name is Kes and I am doing my internship at the Eeftens Lab. I am doing my bachelor in Molecular Life Science at the Radboud university. I am particularly interested in side of molecular science that overlaps with biology, and therefore find myself highly interested in the work done here at the Eeftens lab. I am excited to work with the team and gain some experience in the lab as well. In my spare time I love to read, hear live music and do some baking."
