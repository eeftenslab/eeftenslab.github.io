description: "Hi everyone! My name is Lieke and I am working as a research technician at the RIMLS-Science institute. As of August 2022, I will also be joining the Eeftens team. I have studied Biology and Medical Laboratory Research at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Nijmegen, where I followed a major in Biomedical Research and a minor in Bio-Nanotechnology. I am looking forward to explore the field of chromatin and biophysics! Outside the lab, I enjoy reading, inline skating and horse riding."
