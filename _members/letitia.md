description: "Hey everyone, I'm Letitia Fernandez. I am originally from India. I am here in The Netherlands to pursue my masters. I've completed my bachelors in life science and further completed a postgraduate diploma in
bioinformatics. I'm currently in the first year of my master's, studying medical epigenomics. With Jorine, I'm carrying out my internship where in I will be studying the impact of chromatin organisation on nuclear mechanics.
Apart from academics, I enjoy dancing, cooking and reading. I'm grateful for this opportunity and  excited to be working here!"
