description: "Hi All! My name is Aleid, I am currently doing my Master's degree in Chemistry of Life, and have studied Molecular Life Sciences here in Nijmegen. My internship here at the Eeftens lab will take from November to July. During this time I will focus on the binding of a particular recruiter to DNA. My interests match this internship very well: I like to dive deep into the interactions of biomolecules and would like to find out precisely how and why they behave certain ways. Other interests I have are running and reading, and you can count on me to always have a creative project in the works."
