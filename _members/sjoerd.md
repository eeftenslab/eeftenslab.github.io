description: "Hi! My name is Sjoerd and I join the Eeftens lab for my second master internship. After I finished by bachelors degree in Biology and medical laboratory research at Saxion, I started the master program medical biology here at the Radboud university. After internships in various disciplines ranging from genetics all the way to nanoparticles, I'm still trying to uncover which research discipline is my favorite. This internship is a perfect opportunity to get to know new research disciplines. I hope to learn many new things and most of all, to work on a project I can really dive into and make my own. Outside my study I like to do sports or have a drink with friends alongside a game."
