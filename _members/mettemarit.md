description: "Hello everyone! My name is Mette Marit and I am doing my internship here at Eeftens lab. I am currently studying life sciences at the HAN in Nijmegen and my major was Biomedical Research. I am interested in cells at a molecular level and look forward to gain some experience in a lab. Besides biology I also like to read and to bake."
