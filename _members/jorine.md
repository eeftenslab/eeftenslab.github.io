description: "Jorine did her BSc and MSc at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where she was interested at the interface between chemistry and biology, and the molecular mechanisms driving biological processes. Deciding that was not interdisciplinary enough, she moved to do her PhD at the lab of Cees Dekker at the Technical University of Delft, in the department of Bionanoscience. Here she studied the molecular mechanism of SMC proteins using single-molecule techniques. Her work involved a visit to Columbia University, for which she received an EMBO short term fellowship. She graduated Cum Laude and won the DEWIS award for best female PhD graduate 2017-2018.


Staying in the field of physics behind chromatin organisation, she moved to Princeton University for a postdoc in the lab of Clifford Brangwynne. Here she looked at the role of phase separation in heterochromatin formation. She received a NWO Rubicon fellowship for her work. 


In September 2021, she started her lab at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Combining her experiences from her PhD and postdoc, she will lead the efforts to examine the biophysical mechanisms that drive chromatin architecture, using an interdisciplinary approach.


Outside the lab, Jorine enjoys cooking, reading, leather working, and watching bad reality tv."
