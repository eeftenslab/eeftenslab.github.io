description: "Hi everyone! My name is Jorine and I'm the PI of the biophysics of chromatin lab. I did my BSc and MSc at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where I was interested in the interface between chemistry and biology, and the molecular mechanisms driving biological processes. I enjoyed interdisciplinary research, so I decided to do my PhD at the lab of [Cees Dekker](http://ceesdekkerlab.nl) at the Technical University of Delft, in the department of [Bionanoscience](http://bn.tudelft.nl) . Here I studied the molecular mechanism of SMC proteins using single-molecule techniques. My work involved a visit to Columbia University, for which I received an EMBO short term fellowship. I graduated Cum Laude and won the DEWIS award for best female PhD graduate 2017-2018.

Staying in the field of physics behind chromatin organisation, I moved to Princeton University for a postdoc in the lab of [Clifford Brangwynne](http://softlivingmatter.com). Here I looked at the role of phase separation in heterochromatin formation. I received a NWO Rubicon fellowship for my work. 

In September 2021, I started my lab at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Combining my experiences from my PhD and postdoc, I will lead the efforts to examine the biophysical mechanisms that drive chromatin architecture, using an interdisciplinary approach.

Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking, reading, leather working, and watching bad reality tv."
