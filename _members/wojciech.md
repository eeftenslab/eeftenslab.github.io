description: "Hi! My name is Wojtek and in February 2023 I joined the Eeftens team as a postdoctoral researcher. I received my MSc in Organic Chemistry from the Łódź University of Technology (Poland). Then I did my PhD in the lab of Evan Spruijt at Radboud University, studying the relations between liquid-liquid phase separation and aggregation of proteins. Now I will be working on determining the viscoelastic properties of protein condensates inside living cells. Outside the lab, I enjoy shooting old cars with old cameras."
