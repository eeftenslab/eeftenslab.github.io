description: "Hello everyone! As of November 2022, I am a PhD student in the lab of Jorine. I graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a Master's degree in Biomedical Sciences. During this time, I developed a strong interest in the molecular mechanisms that underlie genome organization. I therefore decided to do an internship in the lab of Benjamin Rowland, where I worked on the cohesin complex and its role in shaping the genome. During my PhD here, I will continue to work on chromatin organization. Specifically, I am aiming to better understand the relation between chromatin architecture and cell morphology."
