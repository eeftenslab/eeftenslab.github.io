description: "Hello everyone! For my (hopefully) last quarter as bachelor student Molecular Life Sciences, I am joining the Eeftens Lab till June 2023. During my bachelor I came to the conclusion that my interest lies with both Molecular and Cell Biology, mainly because of the genome. So, I am happy to join this team for the coming two-and-a-half months and dive into the dynamics of DNA-binding proteins on a single molecule level under the supervision of Luuk."
