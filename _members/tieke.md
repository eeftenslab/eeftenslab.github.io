description: "Hey everyone, My name is Tieke and currently I am looking forward to perform my internship in the Biophysics of Chromatin lab! This year I plan to graduate in my BSc degree of Molecular Life Sciences and to continue my education with the MSc Medical Biology at the Radboud University. Since I am still in the beginning of my specializations my interests are rather broad, but certainly go out to molecular biology on the transcriptional/translational level. During my internship at the lab of Eeftens, I will be studying the mechanical properties of different DNA constructs, each varying in length, sequence and level of methylation. This research will be performed with the Optical Tweezers, which allows single molecule analysis, all very exciting technology! In my free time I like to go hiking, to cook new recipes, to go vintage shopping and drink crafts beers!"
