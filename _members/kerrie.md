description: "Hi! My name is Kerrie and I'm excited to join the Eeftens lab for my first internship. I completed my BSc in Biotechnology at the University of Galway in Ireland before moving to The Netherlands to study Medical Biology with a specialisation in Medical Epigenomics at Radboud University. During my internship I will be working on Luuk's project which aims to understand the biophysical mechanisms behind genome organisation. During my free time I enjoy watching Gaelic football and rugby, reading and travelling."
