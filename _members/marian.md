description: "Hi! My name is Marian, and I’m thrilled to join the Eeftens lab for my second master’s internship. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Molecular Life Sciences at Wageningen University and Research before starting the Human Biology master’s program here at Radboud University. Through internships spanning Developmental Biology to Biomolecular Chemistry, I’m still exploring which area of research excites me most. As a Medical Biology master's student specializing in Human Biology, I’m passionate about understanding the human body at every level—from molecular to systemic—in both health and disease. The chance to learn new techniques and broaden my skills drew me to the Eeftens lab, where I’ll be working on Wessel’s project to study how the force required to deform the cell nucleus with optical tweezers depends on chromatin state."
