description: "Hello everyone! I am Sven and I currently study Medical Epigenomics with a specialization in Science and Communication at the Radboud University. From January 2025, I will be doing my master's internship at Jorine's lab. During my study I followed some courses on the organization of the nucleus and the cytoskeleton, which fascinated me. I hope to learn more about this through my internship. In my daily life I also enjoy playing badminton (where I also do a board year) and I'm active in politics."
