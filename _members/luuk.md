description: "Hi everyone! As of April 2022, I am a 
PhD candidate in the Eeftens team at the department of Cell Biology. I have 
obtained both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Molecular Life Sciences 
at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. I have always been intrigued by 
natural sciences as an overarching theme, but throughout my studies, I have 
mainly established interest at the interface of cell biology and biophysics. It 
fascinates me to learn how fundamental cellular processes are orchestrated 
via the properties of macromolecules. I really like interdisciplinary research, 
as scientists with various backgrounds can combine their efforts into solving 
questions that we are all interested in. During my PhD, I will be investigating 
fundamental aspects of genome architecture, aiming to better understand the
biophysical mechanisms that drive chromatin organization. Together with my 
colleagues, I hope to provide novel insights into the interplay between histone
modifications, chromatin folding and nuclear phase separation. Besides 
science, I enjoy the outdoors, drawing, and discovering music."
