We are thrilled to announce we were awarded an [Interdisciplary Research Platform](https://www.ru.nl/science/research/interdisciplinary-research-platform/news/@1358043/irp-vouchers-awarded-to-12-interdisciplinary/) voucher! 
We will use this funding for a collaborative project with the lab of [Evan Spruijt](https://spruijtlab.com/) at the Institute for Molecules and Materials.
