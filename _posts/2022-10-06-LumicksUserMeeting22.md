Jorine attended the LUMICKS C-trap user meeting in Amsterdam at Lumicks HQ. It was great connecting with other users and familiar and new faces at LUMICKS. We are excited about some of the new features that LUMICKS has been working on, and hopefully more to come from the suggestions we talked about in brainstorm sessions.
