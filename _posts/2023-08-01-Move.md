Due to renovation of the RIMLS research tower, we have temporarily relocated to the Huygens building. For the coming year, we are happily cohabitating with the [Biomolecular Chemistry](http://biomolecularchemistry.nl/) group at the IMM. We look forward to accelerating our ongoing collaborations and fostering new ones on this side of the street!
